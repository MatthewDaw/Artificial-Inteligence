# Artificial-Inteligence

This repository shows my experience related to artifical inteligence related programs. I show case three specific projects. The first one is a self driving car. For the project, I use deep Q reinforcement learning to teach a car to go back and forward between the top left and bottom right corners of the screen without crossing any "sand" barriers the user draws.

The second project is an artifical inteligence that plays doom. This project builds on similar logic as the firt project but also uses a convolutional neural network to "see" the game screen and plays the game as a normal human would. It's objective is primarily to get through a course as fast as possible and it carefully balances the effectiveness of shooting, running, and going directly or indirectly to goal. 

The third program is still a working progress. This page will be updated as progress is made.
